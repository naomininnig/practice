# let's start the practice
## it's easy
### ust need to remember the markdowns
#### start with style:
**bold text** **withour space**
or __two minus lines__ ?
*italic text*  
or _italic text?_
you always need a ~~strikethrough~~
bols and nested **is it _working?_ 
***all bold and italic***

## why isn't working???? must be saved as file name.md (so the github will know to read it)
